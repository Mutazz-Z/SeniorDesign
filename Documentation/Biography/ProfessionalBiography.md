# Dominic Iquina - Professional Biography

## Professional Biography

A results driven Computer Science student specializing in embedded systems and real time software development. My hands on experience is highlighted by my recent co-op, where I independently led the complete software life cycle for the "Precise Fill" feature from initial requirements engineering and architectural design to firmware implementation in C++ and final validation. This experience has solidified my skills in project ownership, systematic problem solving, and low level programming. I am now eager to apply my background in creating robust, end-to-end solutions to a challenging capstone project that delivers a tangible and impactful product

## Project Sought

For my capstone project, I am eager to apply my skills to the development of a complete, user focused product. My experience leading the creation of the "Precise Fill" system has given me a strong foundation in project ownership, from requirements gathering to final implementation. I am highly interested in a software intensive project, such as developing a practical mobile application or creating a small scale video game, where I can focus on user experience and complex logic. Alternatively, I would be very motivated to tackle another embedded systems challenge, building a smart device that interacts with its environment. Ultimately, I am seeking a project that allows me to solve meaningful problems and deliver a functional solution.
