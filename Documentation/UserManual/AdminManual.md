**Q: Can I delete a class permanently?** A: By going to the Classes tab and clicking any specific class you can then press the red X in the top right corner to archive, unarchive, or delete a class.

**Q: Why isn't my new class showing up on the dashboard?** A: The Dashboard only shows classes scheduled for Today. If you created a class that meets on Tuesdays, and today is Monday, it will appear in the Classes List but not on the Dashboard's Today's Schedule
